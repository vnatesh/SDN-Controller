# SDN-Controller
An SDN application implementing optimal routing and load balancing in a mininet network emulator. Communication between hosts, virtual hosts, and switches was tested on several network topologies. The floodlight openflow controller was used to add/delete new nodes to the network as well as manage real-time changes to the topology.
